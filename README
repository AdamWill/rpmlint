rpmlint is a tool to check common errors on rpm packages.  rpmlint can
be used  to test individual packages  before uploading or  to check an
entire distribution. By default  all checks are processed but specific
checks can be performed by using command line parameters.

rpmlint idea comes from the lintian tool of the Debian project.
