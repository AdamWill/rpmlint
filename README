rpmlint is a tool to check common errors on rpm packages.  rpmlint can
be used  to test individual packages  before uploading or  to check an
entire distribution. By default  all checks are processed but specific
checks can be performed by using command line parameters.

rpmlint idea comes from the lintian tool of the Debian project.

Comments and new checks welcome. Send feedback to
<Frederic.Lepied@sugix.frmug.org>.

Implemented checks:

	o tags checks (TagsCheck)
	o Mandrake specific checks (MandrakeCheck)
	o binaries checks (BinaryCheck)
	o configuration files checks (ConfigCheck)
	o locations, permissions, groups and owners checks (FileCheck)
	o suid warnings (FileCheck)
	o pgp checks (SignatureCheck)
	o FHS checks (FHSCheck)

Planned checks:

	o rpm source checks

If you want to change configuration options or the list of checks, use the
global configuration file /etc/rpmlint/config or in the user configuration
file ~/.rpmlintrc.

Configuration files are python source files and should begin with the
following line:

from Config import *

to load configuration functions.

Configuration functions:

resetChecks() resets the list of checks.

addCheck(check) adds the check to the list of checks to try.

addCheckDir(path) adds a path to look for checks.

setOption(name, value) sets the value of the configuration option. See bellow
to have the list of available options.

addFilter(package, reason) adds a filter to remove the output of a check.

Available options:

name		type		default
==============================================
Vendor		string		"MandrakeSoft"
Distribution	string		"Mandrake"
UseBzip2	boolean		1
