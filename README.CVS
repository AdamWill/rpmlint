To get the latest developement version, you may use CVS.  See the
http://qa.mandriva.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/CvsGuide page for more information.

Then just checkout the rpmlint module from the base.

The trick to use it locally is to run the following command line:

$ python -O -u rpmlint.py -C . <rpms>

and to run only a single check, for example to test only FHSCheck:

$ python -O -u rpmlint.py -C . -c FHSCheck <rpms>
