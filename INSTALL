You need the following utilities to run rpmlint:

	o python 1.5.2 or better
	o python rpm support
	o find and xargs
	o objdump
	o file
	o cpio

and the following programs to install it:

	o python 1.5.2 or better
	o sed

You can change the default policy by calling make install with a
POLICY argument like that: make install POLICY=mdk8.2

The policy is defined in the load_policy function in the Config.py
file. This way, we can manage sets of exceptions.
