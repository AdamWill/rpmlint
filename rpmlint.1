.SH NAME
rpmlint \- check common problems in rpm packages
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrpmlint\fR [\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fIFILE\fR|\fIPACKAGE\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrpmlint\fR is a tool for checking common errors in rpm packages.
It can be used to test individual packages and spec files before
uploading or to check an entire distribution.  By default all
applicable checks are processed but specific checks can be performed
by using command line parameters.

\fIFILE\fR can be a rpm package file, a spec file, or a directory.  In
case of a directory, it is recursively searched for rpm and spec files
to check.  \fIPACKAGE\fR is the name of an installed package or a
.BR glob (7)
pattern to match installed packages, unless a file by that name exists.
